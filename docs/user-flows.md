# ChefLogik — User Flows by Role

> This document describes the day-to-day task flows for every actor in the system,
> including which database tables are read and written at each step.
>
> **Notation used throughout:**
> - `R:` — table(s) read
> - `W:` — table(s) written / inserted / updated
> - `→ job` — action is handled asynchronously by a queued job
> - `→ event` — a Laravel Event is fired, picked up by one or more Listeners

```

---

### 1.3 Menu & 86 Management

```
Create / edit menu item
  W: menu_items (allergens, dietary_flags — owner-only write via menu.edit_allergens)
  W: audit_log
  → job: SyncMenuToPlatformsJob (incremental sync on price change, image update)

Manually 86 an item
  W: eighty_six_log (trigger_type = 'manual', started_at = now, ended_at = NULL)
  → event: ItemEightySixed
        → Reverb broadcast: tenant.{tid}.branch.{bid}.orders (within 5s)
        → job: SyncEightySixToPlatformsJob (high queue, within 60s)
  W: audit_log

Restore a manually 86'd item
  W: eighty_six_log (ended_at = now, restored_by = user_id, restore_note)
  → event: ItemRestored → Reverb broadcast + platform sync job
  W: audit_log

Restore an inventory-linked 86 (FOOD SAFETY — manager must confirm)
  R: eighty_six_log (trigger_type = 'inventory_stockout' — must check this first)
  W: eighty_six_log (ended_at, restored_by, restore_note)
        Only allowed when manager_confirmed = true in request body
  W: audit_log
  Note: auto-restore modes (time-based, next-open) are BLOCKED for inventory_stockout trigger_type

  W: audit_log                    (action: 'customer.merged'; reversible within 30 days)

Manually adjust loyalty points
  W: loyalty_transactions         (transaction_type = 'adjustment'; actor_id = owner)
  Note: NEVER directly update customer_tenant_profiles.loyalty_points
        The loyalty_transactions INSERT triggers balance recalculation

Process GDPR erasure request
  W: customer_profiles (status = 'deletion_pending')
  → After 14-day confirmation window:
        W: customer_profiles (phone = 'ANONYMISED-{uuid}', email = null,

        W: customer_tenant_profiles (loyalty_points = 0, status = 'anonymised')
        W: loyalty_campaigns (remove from target_segment)
  Note: loyalty_transactions and order references are RETAINED (financial records)
        but the profile is no longer linkable to a real person
  W: audit_log (action: 'customer.gdpr_erased')

Create loyalty campaign
  R: analytics_customer_segments  (target by RFM segment)
  R: customer_tenant_profiles     (target by tier: bronze / silver / gold)
  W: loyalty_campaigns            (status = 'draft' → 'scheduled' → 'sending' → 'sent')
  → job: SendCampaignJob (default queue) — SMS (Decision 8) or email (Decision 9)

## 10. Platform Admin

**Guard:** `platform` | **Tenant-scoped:** No — bypasses all tenant scoping via `withoutGlobalScope(TenantScope::class)`.

### 10.1 Tenant Management

```
Onboard new tenant (POST /api/platform/tenants)
  R: subscription_plans           (select plan: starter / growth / enterprise)
  W: tenants (name, slug, plan_id, status = 'active')
  W: roles × 8                   (system roles provisioned for the new tenant: owner, branch_manager, ...)

List all tenants
  R: tenants (withoutGlobalScope — all rows returned, no tenant_id filter)
  R: subscription_plans           (join for plan name / features)

Create additional business owner (POST /api/v1/staff/owners — requires owners.manage permission)
  Guard: staff | TenantScope active — scoped to authenticated owner's tenant

  DISPATCH: SendOwnerWelcomeEmailJob
  W: audit_log (actor_type = 'staff', actor_role = 'owner', action = 'owner.created', resource_type = 'user')

Suspend tenant
  W: tenants (status = 'suspended')
  W: personal_access_tokens       (DELETE all tokens WHERE tenant_id = this tenant)
        → All staff + customer sessions terminated immediately

  W: audit_log
```

### 10.2 Platform Monitoring

```
View platform metrics
  Note: Platform Admin does NOT have access to per-tenant operational tables.
        Monitoring is done via infrastructure tooling:

  Queue health:
    → RabbitMQ management UI (queues: critical, high, default, analytics, low)

  Application errors:
    → AWS CloudWatch log groups:
        /cheflogik/api     (API errors, slow queries)
        /cheflogik/worker  (job failures, retry counts)
        /cheflogik/reverb  (WebSocket disconnects)

  Audit trail:
    R: audit_log (withoutGlobalScope — cross-tenant; filtered by tenant_id or actor_id)
        Retained 7 years. Write-only: no UPDATE or DELETE on audit_log ever.
```

## Cross-Role: Order Lifecycle Summary

| Stage | Actor | Tables Read | Tables Written |
|---|---|---|---|

## Cross-Role: Table State Lifecycle

| State | Transitions to | Actor | Tables Written |
|---|---|---|---|
| `free` | `reserved` | Host | `reservations`, `tables` |
| `free` | `occupied` | Host / Waiter | `tables`, `customer_tenant_profiles` |
| `reserved` | `occupied` | Host / Waiter | `tables`, `reservations` (status → seated) |
| `reserved` | `free` | Host | `tables`, `reservations` (status → cancelled) |

| `blocked` | `free` | Branch Manager | `tables` |

All state changes: Reverb broadcast → `tenant.{tid}.branch.{bid}.tables` within 3s.

## Cross-Role: Inventory-Linked 86 Flow

```
DeductStockJob fires on order confirmed
  R: order_items, recipes (status = 'approved'), recipe_ingredients
  W: inventory_items (current_stock -= quantity × wastage_factor)
  W: stock_movements (movement_type = 'sale_deduction')

  If any inventory_item.current_stock reaches 0:

                         started_at = now; ended_at = NULL)
    → event: ItemEightySixed
          → Reverb broadcast (QR/POS within 5s): tenant.{tid}.branch.{bid}.orders
          → job: SyncEightySixToPlatformsJob (high queue, within 60s)
    W: audit_log

Head Chef confirms ingredient restocked
  (physical stock received and GRN confirmed)
  W: goods_received_notes, grn_items, inventory_items, stock_movements (as per GRN flow)

Branch Manager or Owner restores the 86
  R: eighty_six_log (trigger_type check — must be 'inventory_stockout')
  POST /api/v1/menu/items/{id}/restore/{log}  with body: { manager_confirmed: true }

  W: audit_log

  BLOCKED: auto-restore modes (time-based, next-open) do NOT apply to inventory_stockout
           trigger_type check is enforced in EightySixService::restore()
```

## Cross-Role: Recipe Approval Flow

```
Head Chef
  W: recipes (status = 'draft')
  W: recipe_ingredients
  W: recipes (status: draft → pending_approval)

Owner (master menu recipes — branch_id = NULL)
  R: recipes (pending_approval, branch_id IS NULL)
  R: recipe_ingredients, inventory_items (review ingredient mappings)
  W: recipes (status: pending_approval → approved; approved_by, approved_at)
  W: audit_log

Branch Manager (branch-exclusive recipes — branch_id = this branch)
  R: recipes (pending_approval, branch_id = manager's branch)
  W: recipes (status: pending_approval → approved; approved_by, approved_at)
  W: audit_log

Effect of approval
  → From 'approved' status: DeductStockJob deducts stock for orders of this item
  → Orders for items with only 'draft' recipes:
        KDS ticket fires, but NO stock deduction
        W: audit_log (manager alert: recipe not approved)
```

---

## WAC Recalculation (triggered by any GRN confirmation)

```
For each grn_items row confirmed:
  R: inventory_items (current_stock as existing_stock, wac as old_wac)
  R: grn_items (received_qty, unit_cost)

  new_wac = (existing_stock × old_wac + received_qty × unit_cost)

  W: inventory_items (current_stock += received_qty; wac = new_wac)
  W: stock_movements (wac_before = old_wac; wac_after = new_wac; movement_type = 'grn')

  For every recipe using this inventory_item:
    R: recipe_ingredients (quantity per portion), recipes (menu_item_id)
    W: menu_items (cost_price recalculated from all ingredient WACs × portion quantities)
```

---

## Permission Cache Lifecycle

```
On login
  R: user_roles (user_id, role_id, branch_ids)
  R: role_permissions, permissions
  → Redis WRITE: key 'perms:{tenant_id}:{user_id}' = [slug array]; TTL = 5 minutes
  W: personal_access_tokens (abilities encoded with permission list)

On every API request
  → Redis READ: 'perms:{tenant_id}:{user_id}'
  → Gate::before() checks slug against cached array
  → Cache miss: rebuilt from role_permissions + permissions tables

On role change / custom role edit
  W: user_roles or role_permissions
  → Redis DELETE: 'perms:{tenant_id}:{user_id}' for all affected users
        (next request rebuilds from DB — 0 delay in permission change taking effect)
  W: audit_log
```
